## ðŸ“„ README: SQL SELECT Operations

This section covers the use of SQL queries to retrieve and manage data effectively from the `students` table in a relational databases 
-

âœ… 1. SELECT \* and Specific Columns

We use `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns and rows from a table. This is useful for viewing complete data.
To fetch only required fields, specific column names like `name` and `age` can be selected to display focused information.



âœ… 2. WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN

Conditional clauses are applied to filter data based on specific logic.

`WHERE` filters rows based on a condition.
 `AND` combines multiple conditions that must all be true.
 `OR` allows filtering where at least one condition is true.
`LIKE` enables pattern matching in text values (e.g., names starting with a certain letter).
 `BETWEEN` helps select values within a specific range.

These clauses help narrow down query results effectively.

âœ… 3. ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the output based on one or more columns.
Data can be sorted in ascending (default) or descending order, which helps organize and analyze information clearly, such as sorting students by age.
